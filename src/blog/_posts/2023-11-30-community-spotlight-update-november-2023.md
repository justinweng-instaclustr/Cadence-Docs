Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

It's been a couple of months since our last update so we have a lot of updates to share with you.

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Proposal for Cadence Native Authentication ##

Community member [Mantas Sidlauskas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/mantassidlauskas) has drafted a proposal around Cadence native authentication and is asking for community feedback. If you are interested in reviewing the current proposal and providing comments or feedback then please find the proposal details at the link below:

 This is a great example of how we can focus on collaborating together to find a collective solution. A big thank you to Mantas for initiating this work and we hope to see the results of the community input soon!

## iWF Deep Dive and More! ##

During the last few months community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) has continued to share his thoughts about [iWF](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf), a layer implemented on top of Cadence. Since our last update iWF now has a[Python SDK](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-python-sdk). Long has been busy writing articles to share iWF tips and tricks as well as some general ideas about workflows and processes.  Links to Long's articles can be found below:

## New Go Samples for Cadence ##

The Cadence core team is deprecating the old samples for Go and replacing them with new version 2 (V2) samples. They have received a lot of feedback from the community that people are having trouble with old samples, so are in the process of publishing a completely new set of samples for Go.

Here are some major changes to the new samples:

- Easy to use the read - the new samples will be completely based on CLIs instead of running a binary. (This is consistent with current Cadence use experience)
- Simple and transparent worker configuration - the old samples did not provide user a clear demonstration about the relationship between the worker and workflow themselves
- The new samples will help you bootstrap your Cadence workflow faster and easier.
- More vivid and self-explanatory - instead of the traditional "HelloWorld"  type of samples, we want to make it more interesting and engaging. (Each sample will try to simulate a real-life use case to make them more understandable and fun to learn!)

We hope the community will enjoy these changes. If you have any questions or have new an idea for a new sample then please reach out to [Chris Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisqin0610).

The new Go samples can be found at:

Note that the old samples will be removed once the new samples are fully refreshed.

## Cadence Retrospective ##

We are nearly at the end of another year and yes it has gone so fast! Over this year Cadence and the community have evolved and grown. This is a good time to reflect about all the things that have happened in the project over the year and think about a possible roadmap for the future. 

If you have any feedback, or comments about the project or ideas about what features you'd like to see in the roadmap then please feel free to begin a discussion in the #community [Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack)  channel.
